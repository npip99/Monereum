        <p>
          Everytime you spend MNR, the source is obscured amongst dozens of other transactions,
          so that the receiver will never be able to discover who you are. Signatures will allow you
          to prove you're the one who sent the funds, without giving up your public address.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          Everytime you receive MNR, you can generate a new receiving address and get paid
          without ever disclosing your identity. All of your receiving funds will seamlessly
          combine into the same wallet.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          Each transaction you make from your wallet will only cause your funds to mix and churn even more. You can even
          continuously exchange money with yourself to create an impossibly complex web of transactions that,
          from the outside, will look like there were thousands of different people exchanging MNR between each other.

        <p>
          Use the market to generate an new anonymous Ethereum wallet from your MNR, and
          spend it on other Ethereum-based platforms using ETH coins that came from thin
          air.<br/><br/>

          This provides a service that is much easier to use than mixers or inter-coin transfers
          between ETH and XMR. No more trusting centralized exchanges to mix your ETH with others,
          or trusting them to give you XMR after you give them your ETH. Playing mixers with BTC can even
          be illegal if you receive a tainted coin. A MNR coin will never be tainted, as both parties
          will always be obscured, and you can always self-churn to disconnect yourself from the original coin.

          <h1>Smart Contract Compatible</h1>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is an implementation of the Monero protocol within the Smart Contract system of Ethereum.
          Anyone will be able to build Smart Contracts that exchange with MNR to obscure their transaction
          history - opening new opportunities for those who want to build anonymous Smart Contracts, and
          feeding even more transactions to churn the web.<br/><br/>

          The market found on this website is an example of what could be possible.
          Each trade that this market commits will have its sender and receiver obscured.
          MNR can be used as any Smart Contract's base coin, taking a publically disclosing
          Smart Contract and giving it anonymity and privacy in each transaction.
