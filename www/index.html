          Everytime you spend MNR, the source is obscured amongst dozens of other transactions
          within an impossible to trace web of transactions.
          The receiver will never be able to see who sent the funds. Signatures will allow you
          to prove you're the one who sent the funds, without giving up your public address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everytime you want to receive MNR, you can give them a new public address - and your identity never gets disclosed.
          All of your receiving funds will seamlessly combine into the same wallet. Even if you choose to broadcast
          a public address for anyone to send MNR to, each transfer to your public address will be encrypted on the blockchain
          such that only you can decrypt it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every step of the way, you're in control of your own privacy.

          If all of the above already exists using XMR, what's so special about MNR?
        </p>
        <p>
          Simple: It's a Smart Contract, on Ethereum. You can easily use the market to generate an
          new anonymous Ethereum wallet from your MNR, and spend it on other Ethereum-based
          platforms using ETH coins that came from thin air. This is done entirely trustlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provides a service that is much easier to use than mixers, or inter-coin transfers
          between ETH and XMR. You will not have to trust centralized exchanges to mix your ETH with others,
          or trust them to give you XMR after you give up your ETH. Joining a mixer with BTC can
          even be illegal if you receive a tainted coin. An MNR coin will
          never be tainted, as both parties will always be cryptographically secured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Privacy should be a right, and with MNR we give you that right on the Ethereum blockchain.

          <a href="">MNR</a> is an implementation of a modified Monero Protocol within the Smart Contract system of Ethereum,
          with specific attention to interoperability with Ethereum Smart Contracts.
          Anyone will be able to build Smart Contracts that exchange MNR to obscure their transaction
          history - opening new opportunities for those who want to build interactive, and anonymous, Smart Contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The market found on this website is a great proof of concept for what is possible.
          This market runs exclusively off of a <a href="">smart contract</a> on the blockchain.
          Each trade that occurs will have its sender and receiver obscured, securing their privacy.
          MNR can be used as any Smart Contract's base coin, giving anonymity and
          privacy in each transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href="https://github.com/npip99/Monereum">entire repository</a> is public, which includes an explanation of
          the API so you can start supporting MNR in your Smart Contract. There's also a Javascript library available so that your frontend
          will be as seamless as possible. If you have development experience and need help getting your dApp up and running, you can
          contact me using the form at the bottom of the page.

          This has an added benefit that hard forks will never have to happen to Monereum in the case of an upgrade. It would be
          simple to have the next generation of Monereum consume the old generation's coins, leading to a smooth upgrade as
          users transfer MNR to the new coin. This additionally boosts Monereum's value as an investment opportunity
          due to the stability that this provides.
